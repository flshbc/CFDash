## Typical computational implementations: 

### section 1: diffusion (heat equation)
- 1D diffusion

- steady-state multi-layer diffusion

### section 2: convection-diffusion (scalar transport)

- 1D steady-state transport

- 2D steady-state transport 

- Gauss-Seidel method with relaxation


## OpenFOAM practices

- laminar channel flow
